# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the package management conflicts that occur during GitHub Actions runner installation on EC2 instances. The current installation process fails when multiple package managers are running simultaneously, which is common on fresh Ubuntu instances due to automatic updates and cloud-init processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Package Management

**User Story:** As a developer setting up a GitHub Actions runner, I want the installation process to handle package management conflicts gracefully, so that runner configuration succeeds even when system updates are running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the runner installation script encounters a dpkg lock THEN the system SHALL wait for the lock to be released before proceeding
2. WHEN multiple apt processes are running THEN the system SHALL detect and wait for them to complete
3. WHEN cloud-init is still running THEN the system SHALL wait for cloud-init to finish before installing dependencies
4. WHEN package installation fails due to locks THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 5 minutes
5. WHEN all package managers are busy THEN the system SHALL provide clear status messages about what it's waiting for

### Requirement 2: Installation Process Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the runner installation to be reliable and self-healing, so that I don't have to manually troubleshoot package management issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installation script starts THEN the system SHALL check for running package managers before proceeding
2. WHEN waiting for package managers THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and estimated wait times
3. WHEN package installation succeeds THEN the system SHALL verify all required dependencies are properly installed
4. WHEN installation fails after retries THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN the runner is configured THEN the system SHALL validate the runner service is properly started and registered

### Requirement 3: System State Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the installation process to validate system readiness before attempting runner configuration, so that installation only proceeds when the system is in a stable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting runner installation THEN the system SHALL check if cloud-init has completed
2. WHEN cloud-init is running THEN the system SHALL wait up to 10 minutes for completion
3. WHEN system updates are in progress THEN the system SHALL wait for them to complete
4. WHEN the system is ready THEN the system SHALL proceed with runner installation
5. WHEN system validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and exit gracefully

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting runner installation issues, I want detailed error information and recovery suggestions, so that I can quickly resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package lock errors occur THEN the system SHALL identify which processes are holding locks
2. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL suggest manual intervention steps
4. WHEN system resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL check and report disk space and memory usage
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL test connectivity and provide network diagnostics
